# ECDSA Node

A secure and streamlined solution for centralized transfers using Elliptic Curve Digital Signatures. Visit the live project at [https://ecdsa-sudhan.vercel.app/](https://ecdsa-sudhan.vercel.app/).

## Technologies Used

- **NextJS**: A React framework for building server-rendered applications.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building modern designs.
- **Prisma**: A modern database toolkit for Node.js and TypeScript.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for scalable and flexible data storage.
- **ethereum-cryptography**: Enhancing security through Ethereum-compatible cryptographic methods.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
